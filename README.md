### Installation

* Note that if the current version of Windows is 64-bit, installation of both 32 and 64 versions are needed in order to ensure proper installation.
* Make sure to right-click and run the installer with proper administrative right to ensure proper sever installation.

### Getting Started
* When WAMP server is installed launch the application and select phpMyAdmin from the taskbar icon and login using the default credentials of username “root” without a password.
* Continuing, create a new database from the “New” option.
* Afterwards, give the database an appropriate name and select “create”.
* Lastly, navigate to the “Import” tab, find the file which was [downloaded from the repository](https://github.com/konstantinosy/Agile/blob/main/agileDB.sql) via GitHub and finish importing it.
